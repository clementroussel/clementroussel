## QGIS Offline And In The Field

The guest for this episode is Peter Petrik, the CPO of Lutra Consulting. He previously worked in the automotive industry before transitioning to geospatial about eight years ago. Ever since joining Lutra Consulting, he has made use of his programming knowledge and skills, while collaborating with others to develop products and contributions to the open geospatial community. One of their recent developments is Mergin Maps, an open-source software that allows users to take QGIS to the field.
