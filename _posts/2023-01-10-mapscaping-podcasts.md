## Cloud Optimized Point Clouds

In this episode, the discussion revolves around cloud-optimized point clouds. Our guest is Martin Dobias, the CTO at Lutra Consulting. Coming from a background in computer science, and a passion for geospatial, Martin has been part of a team that has done a ton of interesting work in the open source geospatial world. Today, he shares about their latest, state of the art developments in working with point clouds on the web; Cloud Optimized Point Clouds (COPC).

## The Open Geospatial Consortium

The guest in this episode is Dr Nadine Alameh, the CEO of OGC (the Open Geospatial Consortium). She has been here before and talked about open geospatial standards in the episode Open Geospatial Standards – shared standards to solve shared problems. In this episode the conversation is about the OGC organization. Nadine explains to us what OGC is and what it does, and why its work matters.

## Whitebox Tools Is The Backend To Many Frontends

Our guest on the show today is John Lindsay, the creator of Whitebox Tools, a toolset which contains over 500 geospatial analysis tools. John is a professor of Geomatics who got into geospatial in the early 2000s. Many of the tools in Whitebox have novel functionality that are not found in any other software and are free to use.

## QGIS Offline And In The Field

The guest for this episode is Peter Petrik, the CPO of Lutra Consulting. He previously worked in the automotive industry before transitioning to geospatial about eight years ago. Ever since joining Lutra Consulting, he has made use of his programming knowledge and skills, while collaborating with others to develop products and contributions to the open geospatial community. One of their recent developments is Mergin Maps, an open-source software that allows users to take QGIS to the field.

## FOSS4G

Andrea Antonello is an open-source geospatial developer, and part of the organizational team for FOSS4G. He has given many talks and trainings to the geospatial community about open source software development over the last 20 years. He holds a PhD in environmental sciences, and lectures Advanced Geomatics at the Free University of Bolzano. His main works involve open source development for environmental modelling, and geospatial mobile applications.

He dives deep into explaining what the FOSS4G is, who it is for, and how persons and businesses can get involved.

## Essential Geospatial Python Libraries

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for geospatial analysis, and data science in general. Its popularity comes from Python’s high-level, human-readable syntax, and extreme flexibility. Before going any further, lets go ahead and define a couple important terms to know when working with Python.

## LiDAR From Drones

Our guest today is Lukas Fraser, currently the Program Manager for NV5 Geospatial (formerly Quantum Geospatial). Lukas got his start by studying geodesy and geomatics engineering at the University of New Brunswick. Originally, he wanted to get into land survey, but like many students, he ended up taking the first job he was offered, in this case, a job with a local aerial mapping company. This seems to have worked out, as he spent 3 years working for them, before engaging in 3.5 years (and counting) with NV5 on their unmanned systems program.

## Open Drone Map

Stephen Mather, drone-software extraordinaire, and co-founder of the OpenDroneMap ecosystem. Stephen has always had a passion for where biology and geography meet. In university, he gained the GIS knowledge that would eventually lead to supporting the creation of OpenDroneMap during his time with Cleveland MetroParks.

Since its creation, the software’s range has expanded, as well as Stephen’s. Today, he largely focuses on expanding the capabilities of the project, while also maintaining a role as the Systems Administrator for Oberlin College.

## PDAL

PDAL (also pronounced poodle) is the point data abstraction library. It is an open source library which has the unique strength of being able to handle any point cloud format.

PDAL is not the only program for handling point cloud data, but it is the leader for handling point clouds in a geospatial context.

## GDAL – Geospatial Data Abstraction Library

Paul Ramsey is the co-founder of the PostGIS extension — a spatial extension for the PostgreSQL database.

Paul is an open-source software developer — he works on software that is free to download, free to use, and free to remix with other software.

In this article, he enlightens us on GDAL, the geographic data abstraction library, what it is, and its business model.

## Jupyter notebooks for geospatial

Julia Wagemann is a Ph.D. student at the University of Marburg, investigating Big Data technologies for meteorological and climate use.  She is also a visiting scientist at the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Her work is focused on making geospatial data (meteorological and climate) more accessible to users via cloud-based services.  Those interested in the field will find Julia’s tutorials and workflows for Jupyter Notebooks extremely helpful.

## Geospatial Python

Anita Graser is a legendary open-source geospatial Python expert.  With her extensive knowledge of the subject, she is here to convince us of why Python is a great language and how we can all get started learning it. Stick around to see the benefits and learn why Python may or may not be an option for your GIS project.

Anita comes from a GIS background.  She’s been working with QGIS and Python since 2008 as an integration solution to automate mapping and to look at data in different fashions, not just from the command line or in graphs but also in maps.

## QGIS – An opensource geospatial project

QGIS (originally known as Quantum GIS) began in 2002 as a PostGIS data viewer.  It evolved into the beginnings of a useful GIS tool by version 1.0 in 2009. Now, we have QGIS Desktop, Server, Web Client, and a selection of field applications, such as QField and Input.

While users now get far more than your standard data viewer, QGIS has managed to hold a reputation as relatively lightweight, with impressive processing for a free open-source software. The open-source status was embraced by both the geospatial and technological communities, and it maintains status as an ongoing project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).
