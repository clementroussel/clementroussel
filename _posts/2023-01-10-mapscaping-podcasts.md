## QGIS Offline And In The Field

The guest for this episode is Peter Petrik, the CPO of Lutra Consulting. He previously worked in the automotive industry before transitioning to geospatial about eight years ago. Ever since joining Lutra Consulting, he has made use of his programming knowledge and skills, while collaborating with others to develop products and contributions to the open geospatial community. One of their recent developments is Mergin Maps, an open-source software that allows users to take QGIS to the field.

## FOSS4G

Andrea Antonello is an open-source geospatial developer, and part of the organizational team for FOSS4G. He has given many talks and trainings to the geospatial community about open source software development over the last 20 years. He holds a PhD in environmental sciences, and lectures Advanced Geomatics at the Free University of Bolzano. His main works involve open source development for environmental modelling, and geospatial mobile applications.

He dives deep into explaining what the FOSS4G is, who it is for, and how persons and businesses can get involved.

## LiDAR From Drones

Our guest today is Lukas Fraser, currently the Program Manager for NV5 Geospatial (formerly Quantum Geospatial). Lukas got his start by studying geodesy and geomatics engineering at the University of New Brunswick. Originally, he wanted to get into land survey, but like many students, he ended up taking the first job he was offered, in this case, a job with a local aerial mapping company. This seems to have worked out, as he spent 3 years working for them, before engaging in 3.5 years (and counting) with NV5 on their unmanned systems program.
